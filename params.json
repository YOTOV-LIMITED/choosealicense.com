GitHub provides a license chooser, but if you don't know anything about licenses, how are you supposed to make an informed decision?\r\n\r\n[ChooseALicense.com](http://www.choosealicense.com \"Choose A Licence website\") is designed to help people make an informed decision about licenses by demystifying license choices through non-judgmental guidance.\r\n\r\n## Immediate Goals\r\n\r\n* Non-judgmental. Our goal is to help you find a license that meets *your* goals.\r\n* Well designed, but that goes without saying.\r\n* The homepage should have just enough to help 99% of folks make a decision.\r\n* For the 1%, the site will contain a list of licenses common to specific communities and situations.\r\n* Not comprehensive. Seems like an odd goal, but there are a bajillion licenses out there. We're going to have to filter that down to a small list of those that matter.\r\n\r\n## Run It On Your Machine\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com.git\r\ncd choosealicense.com\r\nscript/bootstrap\r\nscript/server\r\n```\r\nOpen `http://localhost:4000` in your favorite browser.\r\n\r\n## Adding a license\r\n\r\nFor information on adding a license, see [the CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-license).\r\n\r\n## License metadata\r\n\r\nLicenses sit in the `/_licenses` folder. Each license has YAML front matter describing the license's properties. The body of the file contains the text of the license in plain text. The available metadata fields are:\r\n\r\n#### Required fields\r\n\r\n* `title` - The SPDX-compliant, human-readable license name\r\n* `source` - The URL to the license source text\r\n* `description` - A human-readable description of the license\r\n* `how` - Instructions on how to implement the license\r\n* `required` - Bulleted list of required rules\r\n* `permitted` - Bulleted list of permitted rules\r\n* `forbidden` - Bulleted list of forbidden rules\r\n\r\n#### Optional fields\r\n\r\n* `note` - Additional information about the licenses\r\n* `using` - A list of notable projects using the license in the form of `project_name: \"url\"`\r\n* `hidden` - Whether the license is hidden from the license list (defaults to true)\r\n* `redirect_from` - Relative path(s) to redirect to the license from, to prevent breaking old URLs\r\n* `featured` - Whether the license should be featured on the main page (defaults to false)\r\n* `nickname` - A shorter, human-readable license name where the SPDX license name (`title` above) is long\r\n* `variant` - Whether the license is a variant of a family of licenses (defaults to false)\r\n* `family` - If part of a license family, the name of the license family (e.g., `GPL`)\r\n* `tab-slug` - If part of a license family, a license slug containing only `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_` characters, used for internal links on the licenses page\r\n\r\n### Auto-populated fields\r\n\r\nThe licenses on choosealicense.com are regularly imported to GitHub.com to be used as the list of licenses available when creating a repository. When we create a repository, we will replace certain strings in the license with variables from the repository. These can be used to create accurate copyright notices. The available variables are:\r\n\r\n#### Fields\r\n\r\n* `fullname` - The full name or username of the repository owner\r\n* `login` - The repository owner's username\r\n* `email` - The repository owner's primary email address\r\n* `project` - The repository name\r\n* `description` - The description of the repository\r\n* `year` - The current year\r\n\r\n## License properties\r\n\r\nThe license properties (rules) are stored as a bulleted list within the licenses YAML front matter. Each rule has a name e.g., `include-copyright`, a human-readable label, e.g., `Copyright inclusion`, and a description `Include the original copyright with the code`. To add a new rule, simply add it to `_data/rules.yml` and reference it in the appropriate license.\r\n\r\n### Rules\r\n\r\n#### Required\r\n\r\n* `include-copyright` - Include a copy of the license and copyright notice with the code.\r\n* `document-changes` - Indicate significant changes made to the code.\r\n* `disclose-source` - Source code must be made available when distributing the software.\r\n* `network-use-disclose` - Users who interact with the software via network are given the right to receive a copy of the corresponding source code.\r\n* `rename` - You must change the name of the software if you modify it.\r\n* `same-license` - Modifications must be released under the same license when distributing the software. In some cases a similar or related license may be used.\r\n\r\n#### Permitted\r\n\r\n* `commercial-use` - This software and derivatives may be used for commercial purposes.\r\n* `modifications` - This software may be modified.\r\n* `distribution` - You may distribute this software.\r\n* `private-use` - You may use and modify the software without distributing it.\r\n* `patent-use` - This license provides an express grant of patent rights from the contributor to the recipient.\r\n\r\n#### Forbidden\r\n\r\n* `trademark-use` - While this may be implicitly true of all licenses, this license explicitly states that it does NOT grant you any rights in the trademarks or other marks of contributors.\r\n* `no-liability` - Software is provided without warranty and the software author/license owner cannot be held liable for damages.\r\n* `modifications` - This software may not be modified.\r\n* `distribution` - You may not distribute this software.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe content of this project itself is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/deed.en_US), and the underlying source code used to format and display that content is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\r\n","google":"72492019","note":"Don't delete this file!
